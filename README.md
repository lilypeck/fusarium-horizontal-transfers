# fusarium-horizontal-transfers

Scripts for analysis of genomics, transcriptomics, population genetics, and horizontal transfers across multiple _Fusarium_ species (_F. xylarioides, F. oxysporum, and F. solani_).

A repository for all custom analysis and plotting scripts for the manuscript 'Horizontal transfers between fungal _Fusarium_ species contributed to successive outbreaks of coffee wilt disease' (Peck et al. 2024).

A _Coffea arabica_ leaf infected with _Fusarium xylarioides_, a vascular wilt pathogen and the causal agent of coffee wilt disease. The leaf exhibits yellowing, a typical early symptom of infection, as the pathogen colonises the plant xylem. Photo: Lily Peck
